Accessibility Requirements
--------------------------
-   [WCAG2 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html): Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.
-   [WCAG 2.4.6 Headings and Labels](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-descriptive.html): Headings and labels describe topic or purpose.
-   [WCAG 3.2.2 On Input](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-unpredictable-change.html): Changing the setting of any user interface component does not automatically cause a change of context unless the user has been advised of the behavior before using the component.
-   [WCAG2 3.3.1 Error Identification](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/minimize-error-identified.html): If an input error is automatically detected, the item that is in error is identified and the error is described to the user in text.
-   [WCAG2 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/minimize-error-cues.html): Labels or instructions are provided when content requires user input.
-   [WCAG2 3.3.3 Error Suggestion](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/minimize-error-suggestions.html): If an input error is automatically detected and suggestions for correction are known, then the suggestions are provided to the user, unless it would jeopardize the security or purpose of the content.
-   [WCAG2 3.3.4 Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/minimize-error-reversible.html): For Web pages that cause legal commitments or financial transactions for the user to occur, that modify or delete user-controllable data in data storage systems, or that submit user test responses, at least one of the following is true:
    1.  Reversible: Submissions are reversible.
    2.  Checked: Data entered by the user is checked for input errors and the user is provided an opportunity to correct them.
    3.  Confirmed: A mechanism is available for reviewing, confirming, and correcting information before finalizing the submission.
-   [WCAG2 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value.html): For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.

Test Method Rationale
---------------------
Review form instructions for completeness and programmatic association to their inputs. Enter erroneous inputs and review error notifications provided to the user.

Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions
---------------------------------------
-   Read-only (e.g. pre-filled) form fields receive keyboard focus and are selectable but cannot be modified. These must be labeled and programmatically determinable, and are tested under SC 1.3.1.
-   Disabled input elements do not receive keyboard focus, cannot be selected, and cannot be modified. These are not included in this test.
-   The combination of an element's accessible name and accessible description is its text alternative.
-   Clicking an option or selecting an option in a form should select the option, but should not initiate a change in context.
-   [Change of context](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-receive-focus.html#context-changedef) is defined in [Understanding SC 3.2.1: On Focus](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-receive-focus.html) as: major changes in the content of the Web page that, if made without user awareness, can disorient users who are not able to view the entire page simultaneously. Changes in context include changes of:
    1.  User agent
    2.  Viewport
    3.  Focus
    4.  Content that changes the meaning of the Web page
    - Note: A change of content is not always a change of context. Changes in content, such as an expanding outline, dynamic menu, or a tab control do not necessarily change the context, unless they also change one of the above (e.g., focus).
    - Example: Opening a new window, moving focus to a different component, going to a new page (including anything that would look to a user as if they had moved to a new page) or significantly re-arranging the content of a page are examples of changes of context.

Test Procedure for Form Changes
------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Form components that change are tested in [Baseline 5. Changing Content](05Changing.md).</p>

Advisory: Tips for streamlined test processes
---------------------------------------------
-   For SC 3.3.1, acceptable techniques include a) shifting focus to an error message informing the user that the previous field needs to be corrected and describing the error, b)refreshing the page upon form submission, then listing the error descriptions and locations at the top of the page. Re-displaying the form and indicating the fields in error within the form is insufficient to meet this requirement. The user should not need to search through the form to find where errors were made.
-   For SC 3.3.4, because the user can review a simple, 1-page form before pressing the submit button on the page, another review mechanism is not required.
