The text below provides the template for the revised Baseline requirements, incorporating the structure for the ACT test rule format.

## Rationale
### Test Rationale

### Test Method Rationale

## Tools Necessary

## Test Rules

### Unique title/identifier for test rule
#### Rule Description

#### Accessibility Requirements
*	WCAG SC X.X.X

#### Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions

#### Accessibility Support
TBD

#### Test Subject Type

#### Test Procedure
##### Selector

##### Test Cases
###### Test Case Mode

###### Test Case

###### Output
Each element tested will return a test result of pass or fail for eash test case as well as a description of any errors causing a failure result. 
/[Test case results are combined with other test case results to provide a cumulative outcome, pass or fail, of the rule. When a rule has multiple test cases, the results of all test cases are combined to give a single result for each selected item. The results are cumulative, meaning that as long as one test case passes, the rule has passed./]
/[If either one of these passed, the rule has passed. Only if both fail, does that element fail the rule./]

##### Outcome
The overall test procedure (accumulating the results of the individual test cases) should return one of the following outcomes:
* Passed – the test target passed the test
* Failed – the test target failed the test
* Cannot tell: it is unclear whether or not the test target passes or fails the test
