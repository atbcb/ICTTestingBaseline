Test Method Rationale
---------------------
Evaluation of captions and audio descriptions to assess its equivalence to synchronized media content generally involves a manual, cognitive comparison of the original content with its alternative(s).

Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions
---------------------------------------
-   [Synchronized media](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-captions.html#synchronizedmediadef) is audio or video synchronized with another format for presenting information and/or with time-based interactive components, unless the media is a media alternative for text that is clearly labeled as such. Synchronized media includes, but is not limited to Web casts, press conferences, and online training presentations.
-   [Captions](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-captions.html#captionsdef) are synchronized visual and/or text alternative for both speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the media content. Additional notes from definition:
    -   Note 1: Captions...convey not only the content of spoken dialogue, but also equivalents for non-dialogue audio information needed to understand the program content, including sound effects, music, laughter, speaker identification and location.
    -   Note 4: Captions should not obscure or obstruct relevant information in the video.
-   [Audio descriptions](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-audio-desc-only.html#audiodescdef) are narration added to or combined with the soundtrack to describe important visual details that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack alone.
-   Captions and audio descriptions need to be available but do not need to be enabled by default.
-   Captions and audio descriptions can be provided in separate media files, i.e., audio described version and captioned version are different files.
-   Transcripts and non-synchronized alternatives alone will not meet this requirement.
-   Captions are not needed when the synchronized media is, itself, an alternate presentation of information that is also presented via text on the Web page.
-   Live captions Exception: Two-way multimedia calls between two or more individuals through web apps are not included in this test; it is only intended for broadcast of synchronized media.
-   Notes from [Understanding SC 1.2.5](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-audio-desc-only.html):
    -   Note 1: For 1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.7, if all of the information in the video track is already provided in the audio track, no audio description is necessary.
    -   Note 2: 1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.8 overlap somewhat with each other. This is to give the author some choice at the minimum conformance level, and to provide additional requirements at higher levels. At Level A in Success Criterion 1.2.3, authors do have the choice of providing either an audio description or a full text alternative. If they wish to conform at Level AA, under Success Criterion 1.2.5 authors must provide an audio description - a requirement already met if they chose that alternative for 1.2.3, otherwise an additional requirement.
-   For this Section 508 baseline, synchronized media is tested for SC 1.2.5; (Level A) SC 1.2.3 is not tested. At the higher conformance level AA, SC 1.2.5 requires audio descriptions and is more restrictive than SC 1.2.3.

Advisory: Tips for streamlined test processes
---------------------------------------------
-   Testing synchronized media is different from testing Baseline [16. Audio-Only and Video-Only content](16AudioVideo.md).
-   Synchronized media players may be software or HTML.
-   At Level AA, SC 1.2.5 applies to synchronized media. The related Level A requirement, SC 1.2.3, should be marked as ‘Not Tested’ in the test report. It is permissible for test processes to add a test for SC 1.2.3 (evaluate a full text alternative for equivalence). Adding such a test would exceed baseline test requirements and would not affect Baseline 17’s outcome.

### WCAG 2.0 Techniques
The following sufficient techniques and/or common failures were considered when developing this test procedure for this baseline requirement:
-   [G93: Providing open (always visible) captions](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G93.html)
-   [G87: Providing closed captions](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G87.html)
-   [G9: Creating captions for live synchronized media](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G9.html)
-   [G78: providing a second, user-selectable, audio track that includes audio descriptions](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G78.html)
