      "AR2": "[WCAG2 SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value): For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links, and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies."

    {
      "heading": "Test Method Rationale",
      "TMR1": "For assistive technology (AT) users, data tables must explicitly associate table data with table row and column headers via programmatic markup. Table markup also facilitates navigation for AT users by providing programmatic landmarks via column and row headers.",
      "TMR2": "When `<table>` elements are used for layout purposes, data table structure elements such as row/column headers, captions, or table summaries are not permitted."

      "LAE1": "Data tables are tables where information in a cell requires a row and/or column header to adequately describe the cell's contents. If a table is used for placement of content for visual aesthetics, it is considered a layout table.",
      "LAE2": "Some content may visually appear to require a data table structure, but linearizing the content reveals that the content is understandable without the table. These elements use styling methods to present content in columns or rows. The information conveyed does not rely on programmatic relationships between column or row headers to be understood. This content is not a data table and should not have associated programmatic table attributes. It should be tested using other baseline tests, such as [13. Structure]({{site.baseurl}}/document-baselines/13StructureDocs) and/or possibly [10. Forms)]({{site.baseurl}}/document-baselines/10FormsDocs) (assocated instructions).",
      "LAE3": "Rows of data that are related must have a row header so assistive technology users can understand the relationship of the row's data cells. Not every table requires a row header. For example, a calendar month is a data table, typically with the days of the week as column headers. The dates in a row are not related so typically, there is no row header present. However, if there was a cell in each row to indicate the week of the month, this cell would serve as a row header for the dates within that row.",
      "LAE4": "Complex data tables are tables that have any one or more of these elements: multiple columns of row headers, multiple rows of column headers, and split or merged cells. These tables must incorporate formatting that establishes programmatically determinable relationships."
