# 14. Headings
## Accessibility Requirements
* [WCAG SC 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html) -- Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.
* [WCAG SC 2.4.6 Headings and Labels](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-descriptive.html) -- Headings and labels describe topic or purpose.
* [WCAG SC 4.1.1 Parsing](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-parses.html) -- In content implemented using markup languages, elements have complete start and end tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not contain duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow these features.
* [WCAG SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html) -- For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Test Method Rationale
Headings must be programmatically determinable. Heading levels must be programmatically determinable and communicate the visual importance of the heading or visual level of the heading structure. Headings must be descriptive.

## Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions
* A page with only one heading on the page does not have a heading level structure and would not be tested for heading structure.
* Pages can have more than one heading level 1
* The heading level 1 on a page is not required to match the page title
* The order of headings may not always be in sequence but may be valid as it relates to the visual structure/importance communicated by visible headings on the page. For example, an `<h2>` heading may be used for a navigation structure that precedes an `<h1>` title on a page.

## Test Procedure for SC 2.4.6 Headings and Labels
### Select/Identify Content
Visually apparent content, which denotes sections of content.

### Test Instructions
1. Check that each heading describes its section of the content. 
      1. Descriptive headings identify sections of the content in relation both to the Web page as a whole and to other sections of the same Web page. 
      1. Descriptive headings also help users find specific content and orient themselves within the Web page.
      
### Test Results
* If any of the above checks fail, SC 2.4.6 and Baseline Requirement 14 fail.

## Test Procedure for SC 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
### Select/Identify Content
Programmatically defined headings and visually apparent content, which denotes sections of content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page.

### Test Instructions
1. Check that each visual heading is identified programmatically as a heading AND that its heading level logically matches the visual heading presentation within the heading structure. 
    1. The most important heading should have the level of 1, and the least important heading should have a level less than the next least important level (up to `<h6>`. 
    1. Headings with an equal or higher level start a new section; headings with a lower level start new subsections that are part of the higher leveled section. 
    1. Either of these techniques is acceptable for each heading:
          * [H42](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H42.html): each heading is marked with `<h1>` to `<h6>`.
          * [ARIA12](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA12.html): each heading is marked with `role=”heading”` and `aria-level=”#”`. If all headings on the page are at the same level, the additional `aria-level=”#”` is not required.
    1. Check that each programmatic heading uses **EITHER** the HTML heading technique H42 `<h1>` to `<h6>` **OR** the ARIA technique `<role="heading" aria-level="#">`. A heading cannot use both techniques per [W3C specification ARIA in HTML](http://w3c.github.io/html-aria/#docconformance) and is not accessibility supported (see [Conformance Requirement 4. Accessibility Support](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html#uc-accessibility-support-head).
1. Check that each programmatically determinable heading is also visually distinguishable as a heading on the page. Content that is not a visual heading should not have a role of heading (for example, heading markup should not be used to communicate something that would otherwise be emphasized but not act as a heading to content after it).

### Test Results
* If any of the above checks fail, SC 1.3.1 and Baseline Requirement 14 fail.

## Advisory: Tips for streamlined test processes
### WCAG 2.0 Techniques
* The following sufficient techniques and/or common failures were considered when developing this test procedure for this baseline requirement:
    * [Technique ARIA12: Using `role=”heading”` and `aria-level=”#”` to identify heading levels](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA12.html)
    * [Technique H42: Using `<h1>` to `<h6>` to identify headings](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H42.html)
    * [Technique G130: Providing descriptive headings](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G130.html)
    * [Technique H88: Using HTML according to spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H88.html) (Accessibility Support Conformance Requirement related to use of `<h1>` in combination with role="heading" and aria-level="#")
