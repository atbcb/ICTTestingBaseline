# 15. Headings
## Rationale
Headings must be programmatically determinable. Headings levels must be programmatically determinable and correct within the heading structure. Headings must be descriptive.

### Test Rationale

### Test Method Rationale

## Accessibility Requirements
* WCAG2: 1.3.1 Info and relationships
    * Technique ARIA12: Using `role=”heading”` and `aria-level=”#”` to identify heading levels
    * Technique H42: Using `<h1>` to `<h6>` to identify headings
* WCAG2: 2.4.6 Headings and Labels
    * Technique G130: Providing descriptive headings 
* WCAG2: 4.1.1 Parsing 
    * Technique H88: Using HTML according to spec (VALID CODE Requirement related to use of `<h1>` in combination with role="heading" and aria-level="#")

## Tools Necessary
* *Headings* favelet - used to reveal headings markup
    
## Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions
* Limitation: Testing tool capability to find HTML <H> and ARIA <role=heading> attribute(s) of the page
* Exception: A page with only one heading on the page does not have a heading level structure and would not be tested

## Test Procedure
### Selector (Identify Content)
Identify the headings and non-headings of the page by visual inspection of the page content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page.

### Test Instructions

#### Tests for SC 2.4.6
1. For each content element identified visually as a heading, check that each heading describes its section of the content (G130). Descriptive headings identify sections of the content in relation both to the Web page as a whole and to other sections of the same Web page. Descriptive headings also help users find specific content and orient themselves within the Web page.
##### Test Results SC 2.4.6
* If the test for SC 2.4.6 fails, then the content is not conformant to SC 2.4.6

#### Tests for SC 1.3.1 and 4.1.1
Execute the ‘Headings’ favelet to reveal the headings markup.
##### Tests for SC 1.3.1:
1. Review the markup inserted on the page.
   1. Check that each element marked as a programmatic heading is a visual heading.
   1. For each visual heading, check that each heading is determined programmatically AND that heading levels are logical and in sequential order. 
      1. The most important heading should have the level of 1, and the least important heading should have a level of 6. 
      1. Headings with an equal or higher level start a new section; headings with a lower level start new subsections that are part of the higher leveled section. 
      1. Either of these techniques is acceptable for each heading:
            * H42: each heading is marked with `<h1>` to `<h6>`.
            * ARIA12: each heading is marked with `role=”heading”`. If all headings on the page are at the same level, the additional `aria-level=”#”` is not required. For multiple heading levels, 'aria-level' must be specified.
###### Test Results for SC 1.3.1
* If any test for SC 1.3.1 fails, then the content is not conformant to SC 1.3.1

##### Tests for SC 4.1.1
1. Check that each programmatic heading uses EITHER the HTML heading technique H42 `<h1>` to `<h6>` OR the ARIA12 technique `<role="heading" aria-level="#">`. A heading cannot use both techniques per [W3C specification ARIA in HTML](http://w3c.github.io/html-aria/#docconformance).
###### Test Results for SC 4.1.1
* If the test for SC 4.1.1 fails, then the content is not conformant to SC 4.1.1

## Baseline Requirement Outcome
* If no content fails, then the content passes the Baseline Requirement
