## Rationale
### Test Rationale

### Test Method Rationale

## Tools Necessary

## Test Rules

### Headings - B15.1-

#### Rule Description 
Headings must be programmatically determinable.

#### Accessibility Requirements
* WCAG2: 1.3.1 Info and relationships
    * Technique ARIA12: Using role=heading to identify headings
    * Technique H42: Using `<h1>` to `<h6>` to identify headings

#### Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions
* Limitation: Testing tool capability to find HTML <H> and ARIA `role=heading` attribute(s) of the page

#### Accessibility Support
* Technologies that support ARIA and HTML h1-h6

#### Test Subject Type
Rendered Page

#### Test Procedure
##### Selector
Identify the headings and non-headings of the page by visual inspection of the page content. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always).

##### Test Mode
Manual inspection

##### Test Tools Necessary / Test Tool Instructions
Step 1. Execute the ‘Headings’ favelet to reveal the headings markup.

Step 2. Review the markup inserted on the page.

##### Test Cases
1.	For each content element identified visually as a heading, check that each heading is determined programmatically using either `<h1>` to `<h6>` or `role=”heading”`
2. For each content element identified visually as a non-heading, check that the content IS NOT determined programmatically using `<h1>` to `<h6>` or `role="heading"`

##### Output
* Passed – either test case passes 
* Failed – no test case passes

### Headings - B15.2-
#### Rule Description 
Headings levels must be programmatically determinable and correct within the heading structure.

#### Accessibility Requirements
* WCAG2: 1.3.1 Info and relationships
    * Technique ARIA12: Using `role=”heading”` and `aria-level=”#”` to identify heading levels
    * Technique H42: Using `<h1>` to `<h6>` to identify headings

#### Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions
* Limitation: Testing tool capability to find HTML <H> and ARIA <role=heading> attribute(s) of the page
* Exception: A page with only one heading on the page does not have a heading level structure and would not be tested

#### Accessibility Support
* Technologies that support ARIA and HTML H1-H6

#### Test Subject Type
Rendered Page

#### Test Procedure
##### Selector
1. Identify the headings of the page by visual inspection of the page content. Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page.

##### Test Case Mode
Manual inspection

##### Test Tools Necessary / Test Tool Instructions
Step 1. Execute the ‘Headings’ favelet to reveal the headings markup.

Step 2. Review the markup inserted on the page.

##### Test Cases
1.	Check that each visual heading has markup that identifies its heading level and fits correctly within the heading structure. The most important heading has the level of 1, and the least important heading has a level of 6. Headings with an equal or higher level start a new section; headings with a lower level start new subsections that are part of the higher leveled section. Either of these techniques is acceptable for each heading:
    1. H42: each heading is marked with `<H1>` to `<H6>`.
    2. ARIA: each heading is marked with `role=”heading”`. If all headings on the page are at the same level, the additional `aria-level=”#”` is not required. For multiple heading levels, 'aria-level' must be specified.

##### Output
* Passed – if test case passes
* Failed – if test case fails

#### Output for 1.3.1
1. Determine the outcome of B15.1
2. Determine the outcome of B15.2
    * Passed: Both outcomes of B15.1 and B15.2 passed
    * Failed: Either outcome of B15.1 and B15.2 did not pass

### Headings - B15.3-
#### Rule Description 
Headings must be descriptive.

#### Accessibility Requirements
* WCAG2: 2.4.6 Headings and Labels
    * Technique G130: Providing descriptive headings 

#### Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions
None

#### Accessibility Support
None

#### Test Subject Type
Rendered Page

#### Test Procedure
##### Selector
1. Identify the headings of the page by visual inspection of the page content. 

##### Test Mode
Manual inspection

##### Test Cases
1. (G130) Check that each heading identifies its section of the content. Descriptive headings identify sections of the content in relation both to the Web page as a whole and to other sections of the same Web page. Descriptive headings also help users find specific content and orient themselves within the Web page.

##### Output for 2.4.6
* Passed – if test case passes
* Failed – if test case fails

### Headings - B15.4-
#### Rule Description 
Programmatic headings with both HTML and ARIA must have a single programmatic heading level.

#### Accessibility Requirements
* WCAG2: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value

#### Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions
None

#### Accessibility Support
None

#### Test Subject Type
Rendered Page

#### Test Procedure
##### Selector
1. Review the headings that are determined programmatically with both HTML `<H>` and ARIA.

##### Test Tools Necessary / Test Tool Instructions
Step 1. Execute the ‘Headings’ favelet to reveal the headings markup.

Step 2. Review the markup inserted on the page.

##### Test Mode
Manual inspection

##### Test Cases
1. Check that each programmatic heading that has both HTML heading `<H>` and ARIA `role="heading"` has the same programmatic heading level. (The # integer within the `<H#>` and `aria-level="#"` must be identical.)

##### Output for 4.1.2
* Passed – if test case passes
* Failed – if test case fails

## Baseline Test Outcome
Pass: All outcomes of B15.1 and B15.2 and B15.3 and B15.4 passed

Fail: Any outcome of B15.1, B15.2 or B15.3 or B15.4 failed
