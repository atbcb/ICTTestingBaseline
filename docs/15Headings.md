# 15. Headings
## Accessibility Requirements
* [WCAG SC 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html) -- Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.
* [WCAG SC 2.4.6 Headings and Labels](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-descriptive.html) -- Headings and labels describe topic or purpose.
* [WCAG SC 4.1.1 Parsing](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-parses.html) -- In content implemented using markup languages, elements have complete start and end tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not contain duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow these features.
* [WCAG SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html) -- For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Test Method Rationale
Headings must be programmatically determinable. Headings levels must be programmatically determinable and correct within the heading structure. Headings must be descriptive.

## Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions
* Exception: A page with only one heading on the page does not have a heading level structure and would not be tested for heading structure.

## Test Procedure for SC 2.4.6 Headings and Labels
### Select/Identify Content
Visual Headings on the page

### Test Instructions
1. Check that each heading describes its section of the content (G130). 
      1. Descriptive headings identify sections of the content in relation both to the Web page as a whole and to other sections of the same Web page. 
      1. Descriptive headings also help users find specific content and orient themselves within the Web page.
      
### Test Results
* If any of the above checks fail, this SC fails, and the Baseline Requirement fails

## Test Procedure for SC 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
### Select/Identify Content
Visual headings and headings structure on the page. Headings are often in a larger, bolded font separated from paragraphs by extra spacing (though not always). Note the hierarchy and structure of each heading with respect to other headings on the page.

### Test Instructions
1. Check that each visual heading is identified programmatically as a heading AND that its heading level is logical within the heading structure. 
      1. Headings levels go from 1 (most important) to 6 (least important), but it is not required that heading levels start with 1.
      1. Headings with an equal or higher level start a new section; headings with a lower level start new subsections that are part of the higher leveled section. 
      1. Either of these techniques is acceptable for each heading:
          * [H42](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H42.html): each heading is marked with `<h1>` to `<h6>`.
          * [ARIA12](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA12.html): each heading is marked with `role=”heading”` and `aria-level=”#”`. If all headings on the page are at the same level, the additional `aria-level=”#”` is not required.

### Test Results
* If any of the above checks fail, this SC fails, and the Baseline Requirement fails

## Test Procedure for SC 4.1.1 Parsing
### Select/Identify Content
Programmatic Headings

### Test Instructions
1. Check that each programmatic heading uses EITHER the HTML heading technique H42 `<h1>` to `<h6>` OR the ARIA12 technique `<role="heading" aria-level="#">`. A heading cannot use both techniques per [W3C specification ARIA in HTML](http://w3c.github.io/html-aria/#docconformance).

### Test Results
* If the above check fails, this SC fails, and the Baseline Requirement fails.

## Test Procedure for SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value
### Select/Identify Content
Programmatic Headings

### Test Instructions
1. Check that each programmatic heading is a visual heading on the page. Content that is not a visual heading should not have a role of heading.

### Test Results
* If the above check fails, this SC fails, and the Baseline Requirement fails.

## Advisory: Tips for streamlined test processes
### WCAG 2.0 Techniques
* The following sufficient techniques and/or common failures were considered when developing this test procedure for this baseline requirement:
    * [Technique ARIA12: Using `role=”heading”` and `aria-level=”#”` to identify heading levels](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA12.html)
    * [Technique H42: Using `<h1>` to `<h6>` to identify headings](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H42.html)
    * [Technique G130: Providing descriptive headings](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G130.html)
    * [Technique H88: Using HTML according to spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H88.html) (VALID CODE Requirement related to use of `<h1>` in combination with role="heading" and aria-level="#")
