# 7. Images

## Accessibility Requirements
* [WCAG2 SC: 1.1.1. Non-Text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html):  All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for [specific] situations listed. 
* [WCAG2 SC: 1.4.5 Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-text-presentation.html):  If the technologies being used can achieve the visual presentation, text is used to convey information rather than images of text except for [specific situation listed].
* [WCAG2 SC: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html):For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies. 

## Test Method Rationale
All meanngful and decorataive images must be evaluated. Tests for certain image types are specified. 

## Limitations, Assumptions, Exceptions
  * Decoration, Formatting, Invisible: If image is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology.
 * CAPTCHA: If the purpose of the image is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the image(s) are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.   
 * Font icons are considered a form of ASCII art, graphics generated with text.
 * Images of text which are essential to the information being conveyed are exempt from SC 1.4.5. Logotypes (text that is part of a logo or brand name) are considered essential.
 * Equivalent descriptions for an image within page text would render an image decorative.
 * Text equivalents for meaningful images are found in the accessible name and accessible description. Page text is not checked for meaningful image descriptions.
 
## Test Procedures 
### Select/Identify Content
1. Identify any meaningful images that conveys information (include images of text, functional images used to initiate action, image maps, etc.)
1. Review the image properties and context of the meaningful image

### Test Instructions for Meaningful Images (SC 1.1.1) 
1. Check that the alt text provides an equivalent description of the image.
1. Check that the text of the page or a longdesc attribute conveys the information provided in the image
1. Check that the combination of accessible name and accessible description provide an equivalent description. Numerous attributes contribute to the computation of the accessible name and accessible description. [HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0 for img](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/WD-html-aam-1.0-20171027/#img-element)

#### Test Results
* If none of the above checks pass, then this SC fails and this baseline fails.

### Test Instructions for 4.1.2
1. Check that the role is not "presentation".
1. Check that aria-hidden state is not set to true. 

#### Test Results
* If any of the above checks fail, then this SC fails and this baseline fails.

### Selector
Decorative Images

### Test Instructions for Decorative Images (SC 1.1.1)
1. Check that the role is "presentation". 
1. Check that aria-hidden state is set to true.
1. Check that the combination of accessible name and accessible description is empty. 
   * Numerous attributes contribute to the computation of the accessible name and accessible description. 
   * [HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0 for img](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/WD-html-aam-1.0-20171027/#img-element)
   
#### Test Results
* If ALL of the above checks fail, then this SC fails and this baseline fails.

### Selector
Icon Fonts

### Test Instructions for 1.1.1
1. Check that the icon font has aria-hidden set to true. 
2. Check that meaningful icon fonts have a text equivalent (accessible name/description).
*<<KE comment: above tests do not cover google icon fonts correctly, which are accessible without these properties. One way to account for these is to check CSS for google icon reference and exempt them from this test.>>*

#### Test Results
* If any of the above checks fail, then this SC fails and this baseline fails.

### Selector
Images of Text (Logos are exempt)

### Test Instructions for 1.4.5
1. Check that the image of text can be visually customized to a user's requirements.
   * For example, a Web site allows users to specify font settings and all images of text on the site are then provided based on those settings.

#### Test Results
* If any of the above checks fail, then this SC fails and this baseline fails.

### Selector
CAPTCHA

### Test Instructions for 1.1.1
1. Check that the combination of accessible name and accessible description identify and describe the purpose of the CAPTCHA
1. Check that alternative forms of CAPTCHA are provided, at a minimum, for users without vision and users without hearing.

#### Test Results
* If any of the above checks fail, then this SC fails and this baseline fails.

## Advisory Tips:
* An example of an accessible CAPTCHA is [recaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo?invisible=true)
