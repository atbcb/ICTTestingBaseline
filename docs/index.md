ICT Testing Baseline for Web Accessibility
==============================================

This is the Section 508 ICT Testing Baseline ***for Web***, which determines conformance of web content with the [Revised Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines), as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d).

## Background
In January of 2017, the U.S. Access Board released the final rule to revise the Section 508 standards from 2001.  The Revised Section 508 Standards reference the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, Level (A) and (AA) Success Criteria and conformance requirements as the “new” Section 508 standards for Web content.  The ICT Testing Baseline for Web was originally developed as the foundation to update the [DHS Trusted Tester test process](https://section508.gov/test/trusted-tester). With the Trusted Tester process and training completed, the ICT Testing Baseline Working Group (ITBWG) resumed efforts to finalize the Baseline and continue promoting the Baseline as a unified foundation for conformance test processes to improve 508 testing across government. The Baseline for Web was written for those creating a comprehensive test process. However, Federal agencies that have a 508 test process can use the Baseline to determine how well their test process accurately tests for all Section 508 requirements. As part of the Federal Chief Information Officers Council, Accessibility Community of Practice (ACOP), the ITBWG is led by US federal government representatives from [General Services Administration (GSA) Government-wide IT Accessibility Program](https://www.section508.gov/) and the [US Access Board](https://www.access-board.gov/).

## Document status and feedback
Updates to the ICT Testing Baseline for Web are in progress. This is a DRAFT of version 3.0 and not yet approved for distribution by the Federal Chief Information Officers Council (CIOC) Accessibility Community of Practice (ACOP).

### How to contribute
