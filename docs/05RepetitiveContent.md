# 5. Repetitive Content 
## Rationale
### Test Rationale
A method must be provided to bypass blocks of repeated content or links on pages, allowing a user to move directly to page-specific content.

Groups of navigation links are usually provided along the top and/or left of multiple pages to provide quick navigation to other areas of a Web site. In addition, some groups of pages may repeat blocks of content (other than navigational controls).

For users who can see and use a mouse, bypassing navigation links and other blocks of content is simply a mouse movement followed by a click. However, for users who cannot use a mouse, repetitive content can be a serious impediment to productivity. For example, for screen reader users, if they must read content that is repeated on each page and cannot bypass it, their experience on the page can be very frustrating. 

A common method used to bypass repetitive content is internal (same page) links, but other methods such as a navigation tree, are acceptable.

### Test Method Rationale
To enable equitable use by keyboard-only users, there must be a keyboard-accessible method to bypass repetitive content. 

## Accessibility Requirement
WCAG SC 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks - A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple Web pages.

## Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions
* Small repeated sections such as individual words, phrases or single links are not considered blocks for the purposes of this provision.
* Most web browsers provide keyboard shortcuts to move the user focus to the top of the page, so if a set of navigation links is provided at the bottom of a web page providing a "skip" link may be unnecessary. 
* Repeated content that is contained in its own separate frame is not included in this test.

* Access must be via a physical keyboard. Specifically excluded from this test is the use of an on-screen keyboard or using the Mouse-Keys feature in Windows. 

## Test Procedure
### Selector (Identify Content)
Blocks of content that are repeated on multiple pages including navigation links, page headers and banners.

### Tests for SC 2.4.1
1.	Use the keyboard to navigate toward repetitive blocks of content. Some bypass functions may not be visible until they receive focus.
2.	Check that a method is provided to bypass repetitive content before the repetitive content.    
3.	Use the keyboard to verify the functionality of the bypass function.
    * Activate the bypass function. 
    * Check that the focus is shifted past the repetitive content. If there is only text/no interactive component to recieve the shift of focus, it may not be evident that a focus shift occurred.

### Results for SC 2.4.1 
* If any of the above checks fail, then this SC fails.

## Baseline Requirement Outcome
* If any SC fails, then this Baseline fails.

## Advisory: Tips for streamlined test processes
* If bypass method is provided but cannot be activated by keyboard, this is also a failure of the Keyboard test (#1).
* If bypass method is in the focus order but is not visible when it has keyboard focus, this is a failure of the Focus (visible) test (#2). 
* If there is a need for multiple bypass methods on a page, each method must describe its purpose to comply with the links requirement (#16). For example, a page with repetitive links should have a descritive bypass method. If there is also a block of repetitive content, this should have a separate descriptive bypass method.
* This baseline test covers bypass methods that are functional with just a keyboard. The following WCAG Sufficient Techniques require additional assistive tools to function as bypass methods - H69: Providing heading elements at the beginning of each section of content, ARIA11: Using ARIA landmarks to identify regions of a page. These may be included in test processes with test environments that support these techniques.
