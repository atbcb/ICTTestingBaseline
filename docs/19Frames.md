# 19. Frames and iFrames

## Accessibility Requirements
* [WCAG SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html) -- For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.

**This Baseline Requirement applies to Web content only.**

### Test Method Rationale
While users with vision can recognize the structure presented by frames and iframes, users without vision rely on programmatic elements to determine their content. This test method determines the adequacy of the code to describe the contents of any `<frame>` or `<iframe>` for Assistive Technology.

## Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions
* In HTML5 the `<frame>` element is marked as obsolete. The `<iframe>` element remains part of the HTML5 specification. While the `<frame>` element has been deprecated in HTML5, testers may still encounter web pages and/or web applications with code that, while outdated, can and should still be accessible.
* The tests included in this Baseline requirement do not apply to native software applications.

## Test Procedure for SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value
### Frames
#### Identify Content
Frames

#### Test Instructions
1. Check if each `<frame>` has a `title` attribute that describes its content.

#### Test Results
If any of the above checks fail, then SC 4.1.2 and Baseline Requirement 19 fail.

### iFrames
#### Identify Content
iFrames

#### Test Instructions
1. Check if the combination of [accessible name and description](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#iframe-element) for each `<iframe>` describes its content

#### Test Results
If any of the above checks fail, then SC 4.1.2 and Baseline Requirement 19 fail.
