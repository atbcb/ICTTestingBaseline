# 23. Multiple Ways
## Accessibility Requirements
* [WCAG SC 2.4.5 Multiple Ways](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-mult-loc.html) -- More than one way is available to locate a Web page within a set of Web pages except where the Web Page is the result of, or a step in, a process.

**This Baseline Requirement applies only to Web content.**

## Test Method Rationale
This baseline requires a manual check for multiple techniques to locate a web page.

## Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions
* Exceptions: web pages that are the result of, or a step in, a process are not included in this test.
* As defined in [E204.5](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines#E205-content) and [E207](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines#E207-software) of 36 CFR 1194, WCAG SC 2.4.5 Multiple Ways **DOES NOT** apply to non-Web documents and software.

## Test Procedure for SC 2.4.5 Multiple Ways
### Identify Content
Web page within a set of related Web pages.

### Test Instructions
1. Check that the page provides two or more ways to locate a Web page within a set of web pages; these may include (but are not limited to) techniques such as:
    * site maps
    * site search
    * tables of contents
    * navigation menus or dropdowns
    * navigation trees
    * links between pages

### Test Results
If the above check fails, then SC 2.4.5 and Baseline Requirement 23 fail.

## Advisory: Tips for streamlined test processes
* Additional techniques for locating a Web page may be available beyond those listed in the test instructions.
