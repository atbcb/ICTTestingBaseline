| Various Sections                            | Added “Note: In Chrome, Inspect does not reveal the correct information for Flash content” and the note “Interactive Flash and embedded Java content should be tested in IE to determine the accessibility of the coded content”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Section 5, Skip Links                       | Rationale: Changed title to “Repetitive Content;” changed “To enable equitable use by keyboard only users, there must be a method to skip past repetitive content. This can be provided by adding internal links to bypass repetitive content. Similarly, for screen reader users, if they must read content that is repeated on each page and cannot skip past it, their experience on the page can be very frustrating” to “To enable equitable use by keyboard only users, there must be a method to skip past repetitive content. Similarly, for screen reader users, if they must read content that is repeated on each page and cannot skip past it, their experience on the page can be very frustrating. A common method used to bypass repetitive content is internal (same page) links.” Test Instruction 2: Added various instructions: location of skip target, testing if no skip links are marked, testing skip function, testing if no interactive target. |
| Section 7, Images                           | Rationale: Added “If font-based graphics are used to provide information, equivalent information must be provided in an accessible format;” Test Instruction 1: Step a, added bullet: “Look for images that are rendered by using font-based graphics (e.g. up-arrows to indicate sort order, etc.).”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Section 8, Color (meaning)                  | Advisory: added bullet “WAF’s Greyscale test works in more cases than WAT’s, although there may be some sites where both work only partially or not at all.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
