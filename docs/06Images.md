# 6. Images

## Accessibility Requirements
* [WCAG2 SC: 1.1.1. Non-Text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html) -- All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for [specific] situations listed. 
* [WCAG2 SC: 1.4.5 Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-text-presentation.html) -- If the technologies being used can achieve the visual presentation, text is used to convey information rather than images of text except for [specific situation listed].
* [WCAG2 SC: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html) -- For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.

**This Baseline Requirement applies to both software and Web content.**

## Test Method Rationale
All meaningful and decorative images must be evaluated. Tests for certain image types are specified.

## Limitations, Assumptions, Exceptions
* Commonly used image formats include .jpg, .png, .svg, .gif, .tiff, .bmp. Other graphic formats are also in use and should be considered for this test.
* Decoration, Formatting, Invisible: If image is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology.
* CAPTCHA: If the purpose of the image is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the image(s) are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.
* Images of text which are essential to the information being conveyed are exempt from SC 1.4.5. Logotypes (text that is part of a logo or brand name) are considered essential.
* Equivalent descriptions for an image within page text could allow an image to be considered decorative. However, this does not necessitate removal of any accessible text attributes from the image.
* While a `longdesc` attribute has been used historically to provide extended description for images and is listed as a sufficient technique in WCAG ([H45](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H45.html)), the technique [is not currently well supported for accessibility](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/longdesctestcases.htm); therefore, this Baseline does not accept the technique.
 
## Test Procedures for SC 1.1.1 Non-Text and 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value
### Identify Content
1. Identify all images
2. Review the context of the image to determine the purpose of the image:
    * **Meaningful:** conveys information (include images of text; functional images used to initiate action, convey meaning, or prompting a response; image maps, etc.)
    * **Decorative:** conveys no meaningful information or is described in text content
    * **Icon Fonts:** decorative font rendered as an image
    * **Text:** image of text, except where the text is part of a logo
    * **CAPTCHA:** designed to determine if content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer

### Meaningful Images
#### Meaningful Images - Web
##### Test Instructions
If the image is meaningful:
1. Check that the combination of accessible name and accessible description provide an equivalent description. Numerous attributes contribute to the computation of the accessible name and accessible description. [HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0 for img](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#img-element)
   1. Equivalent description of the image on the page is acceptable. 
       1. If this is the **only** method used for an image, check that the image passes **Decorative Images - Web**.
1. Check that the role is NOT "presentation".
1. Check that aria-hidden is NOT set to true.

##### Test Results
* If check 1 fails, then SC 1.1.1, SC 4.1.2, and Baseline Requirement 6 fail.
* If check 2 or 3 fails, then SC 4.1.2 and Baseline Requirement 6 fail.

#### Meaningful Images - Windows-Native Software
##### Test Instructions
If the image is meaningful:
1. Check that the combination of values from the following UIA properties provides an equivalent description:
    * LocalizedControlType
    * Name
    * HelpText
    * The static text from elements referenced by the image's LabeledBy property
    * The static text from elements referenced by the image's DescribedBy property
1. Check that the image is included in the control view of the UIA tree, i.e., IsControlElement = TRUE.

##### Test Results
* If any of the above checks fail, then SC 1.1.1, SC 4.1.2, and Baseline Requirement 6 fail.

### Decorative Images
#### Decorative Images - Web
##### Test Instructions
If the image is decorative, check that at least one of the following is true:
1. The ARIA role is "presentation".
1. The aria-hidden state is set to "true".
1. The combination of accessible name and accessible description is empty (e.g. "").
    * Numerous attributes contribute to the computation of the accessible name and accessible description. 
    * [HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0 for img](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#img-element)
1. The image is inserted via CSS (e.g., using a background image)

##### Test Results
* If all of the above checks fail, then SC 1.1.1, SC 4.1.2, and Baseline Requirement 6 fail.

#### Decorative Images - Windows-Native Software
##### Test Instructions
If the image is decorative:
1. Check that the image does NOT appear in the Control view of the UIA tree.

##### Test Results
* If the above check fails, then SC 1.1.1, SC 4.1.2, and Baseline Requirement 6 fail.

### Icon Fonts
#### Icon Fonts - Web
##### Test Instructions
If the icon font is meaningful, check that ALL of the following are true:  
1. The icon has ARIA role=”img” 
2. The icon’s aria-label value provides an accurate text equivalent
3. The icon does not have aria-hidden set to “true”

If the icon font is decorative:
1. Check that aria-hidden is true

**Note:** Methods to provide alternative text for icon fonts must be accessibility supported (see [Conformance Requirement 4. Accessibility Support](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html#uc-accessibility-support-head)).

##### Test Results
* If any of the above checks fail, then SC 1.1.1, SC 4.1.2, and Baseline Requirement 6 fail.

#### Icon Fonts - Windows-Native Software
##### Test Instructions
TBD

##### Test Results
* If any of the above checks fail, then SC 1.1.1, SC 4.1.2, and Baseline Requirement 6 fail.

### Captcha Images (Web Only)
#### Test Instructions
If the Image is a Captcha image:
1. Check that the combination of accessible name and accessible description identify and describe the purpose of the CAPTCHA.
2. Check that alternative forms of CAPTCHA are provided, at a minimum, for users without vision and users without hearing.

#### Test Results
* If any of the above checks fail, then SC 1.1.1, SC 4.1.2, and Baseline Requirement 6 fail.

## Test Procedures for SC 1.4.5 Images of Text
### Identify Content
Identify any images of text, except where a particular presentation of text is essential to the information being conveyed (e.g., logotypes or text that is part of a logo or brand name).

### Test Instructions 
1. Check that the technologies being used CANNOT achieve the visual presentation using text to convey information rather than images of text.
2. Check that the image of text can be visually customized to a user's requirements.
    * For example, a Web site or native software allows users to specify font, size, color, and background settings, and all images of text are then provided based on those settings.

### Test Results
* If any of the above checks fail, then SC 1.4.5 and Baseline Requirement 6 fail.
