Accessibility Commitment
Updated: 09/07/2025
We the Social Security Administration, are dedicated to ensuring that our services and information technology systems are accessible to individuals with disabilities. Accessibility is essential for providing an inclusive and user-friendly experience.

As described in Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act, SSA aspires to be a model employer of people with disabilities. We understand that an essential part of being a model employer is having a robust Information Technology (IT) accessibility program and providing reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals.

Our commitment to accessibility extends to all content and online services provided through our publicly available technology. Section 504 extends this accessibility commitment to programs and services.

Our Commitment to Inclusivity and Reasonable Accommodations
SSA is committed to ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to access our programs, activities, and facilities, regardless of disability, in accordance with Section 504. The Social Security Administration is committed to maintaining and improving our service to individuals with disabilities.

More about Section 504
Our Commitment to Accessible Information Technology
Our comprehensive approach to Section 508 compliance helps people with disabilities use agency Information Technology (IT). Our IT accessibility test method aligns with the Section 508 ICT Testing Baseline. We surpass Section 508 requirements by incorporating AAA guidelines from WCAG 2.0, as well as multiple WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.2 guidelines. Our accessibility test method is further informed by Usability Studies conducted with individuals who have disabilities, as well as best practices recommended by oversight agencies and the Federal CIO Council.
