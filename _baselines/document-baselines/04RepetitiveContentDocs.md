## 4. Repetitive Content – Not Applicable to Documents

### No Accessibility Requirements

This Baseline test for repetitive content checks for WCAG SCs that Section 508 does not apply to non-web documents. It is from the ICT Testing Baseline for Web and was not removed to maintain harmonization.

Per Section 508 E205.4 Accessibility Standard for electronic content exception, non-web documents shall not be required to conform to the following success criteria:

-   WCAG SC 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks – A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple Web pages.
-   WCAG SC 3.2.3 Consistent Navigation – Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple Web pages within a set of Web pages occur in the same relative order each time they are repeated, unless a change is initiated by the user.
-   WCAG SC 3.2.4 Consistent Identification – Components that have the same functionality within a set of Web pages are identified consistently.
