## Introduction

### ICT Testing Baseline for Electronic Documents

This document presents baseline tests for conformance to Revised 508 Standards for Electronic Documents. These standards reference the [WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) to determine document accessibility. The baseline tests contained here establish the minimum evaluation criteria to ensure that electronic documents meet Section 508 requirements. While the ICT Testing Baseline for Electronic Documents is not intended to serve as a comprehensive test process itself, it provides essential guidance to be integrated into test processes to determine Section 508 conformance.

Federal agencies are encouraged to develop electronic document accessibility test processes that incorporate all baseline tests outlined here. While agencies may introduce additional tests specific to their needs, any test process claiming alignment with this baseline must include all baseline tests and produce baseline test results. This common standard promotes consistency across the government, enabling the reliable exchange of accessibility test results between agencies. Non-baseline tests should be identified and reported separately to maintain transparency and integrity in testing.

Using the ICT Testing Baseline for Electronic Documents fosters consistent Section 508 conformance testing for electronic documents. Agencies following this baseline will produce results based on established evaluation procedures, allowing for confidence in the results shared across the government.

### Background

The ICT Testing Baseline for Web was originally created to standardize Section 508 web conformance testing across the U.S. federal government. Building on this baseline, the ICT Testing Baseline for Electronic Documents applies these principles to ensure the accessibility of electronic documents across agencies. Baselines across different ICT types streamline accessibility test processes and improve consistency in Section 508 compliance results.

The first version of the harmonized web baseline emerged out of 2009 collaboration between the accessibility teams at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA). This baseline later served as the foundation for DHS to develop the [Section 508 Trusted Tester Conformance Test Process](https://www.dhs.gov/trusted-tester) (version 3).

In October 2012, experts from various federal agencies came together to form the Accessible Electronic Document Community of Practice (AED COP), aiming to enhance accessible content, promote advancements in accessibility, and develop reusable accessible resources for multiple agencies. Together with the existing ICT Testing Baseline for Web, this effort laid the foundation for the ICT Testing Baseline for Documents, which outlines essential steps to ensure that electronic documents are accessible and compliant with Section 508 standards.

The 2017 revision of Section 508 incorporated the WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA Success Criteria into federal accessibility requirements. The ICT Testing Baseline for Electronic Documents aligns with these updated standards and provides a common framework for federal agencies to evaluate electronic document accessibility test processes.

This baseline is led by the [U.S. Access Board](https://www.access-board.gov/) and [General Services Administration (GSA)](https://www.section508.gov/), with contributions from several other federal agencies. It builds upon lessons learned from prior efforts to harmonize accessibility testing processes, with the goal of improving accessibility compliance for electronic documents.

### Revised Section 508 Standards

Federal agencies were required to comply with the Revised Section 508 Standards by January 2018\. These standards reference the WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA Success Criteria and incorporate requirements specific to documents (e.g., structure, tags, headings, and alternative text for images). Although Section 508 does not mandate compliance with WCAG 2.2, this Baseline references the improved explanations and guidance from WCAG 2.2 documentation.

### Tools Agnostic

Like the ICT Testing Baseline for Web, the ICT Testing Baseline for Electronic Documents is agnostic regarding testing tools. Each baseline test identifies the accessibility requirement being tested, the document content subject to evaluation, and step-by-step instructions for determining test outcomes. Agencies can employ any tools that align with this baseline to ensure consistent and reliable testing outcomes.
