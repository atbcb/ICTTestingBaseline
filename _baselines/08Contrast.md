## 8. Contrast

### Accessibility Requirements

-   [WCAG SC 1.4.3 Contrast (minimum)](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html) -- The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following:
    -   Large Text: Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1;
    -   Incidental: Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement.
    -   Logotypes: Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no minimum contrast requirement.

### Test Method Rationale

This test is conducted to evaluate equal access to information for all users, including those who may experience difficulty in discerning between items with low contrast.

### Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions

-   **Exception:** The following types of text and images of text are not included in this test:
    -   Logotypes: logo or brand name
    -   Inactive (disabled) user interface components
    -   Pure decoration purposes and not meaningful, having no functionality
    -   Contained within a picture that contains significant other visual content
-   Testing of text contrast changes includes changes due to mouse hover and selection status.
-   Disabled input elements do not receive keyboard focus, cannot be selected, and cannot be modified. These are not required to meet contrast ratio requirements. **Note:** Read-only and disabled interface components are not the same. Disabled interface components can be considered inactive interface components; read-only interface components are active interface components and must meet contrast ratio requirements.
-   Large scale text is defined as at least 18 point text or 14 point bold text.

### 8.1 Test Procedure for Contrast (minimum)

**Baseline Test ID:** 8.1-ContrastMinimum
#### Identify Content
<p id="1IC">All visible text  **AND**  images of text (except those noted in Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions above)</p>

#### Test Instructions
<ol id="1TI">
    <li id="1TI-1">Determine the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#contrast-ratiodef" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contrast ratio</a> of foreground text and background.</li>
    <li id="1TI-2">Check that the contrast ratio is at least 4.5:1. [SC 1.4.3]</li>
    <li id="1TI-3">If the contrast ratio is less than 4.5:1, check that the ratio is at least 3:1 <strong>AND</strong> the font meets one of the following criteria: [SC 1.4.3]
        <ul>
            <li>At least 18 point (23.94 pixels)</li>
            <li>At least 14 point (18.62 pixels) <strong>AND</strong> bold (at least 700 font weight)</li>
        </ul></li>
</ol>

#### Test Results
<p id="1TR">If both of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 8.1-ContrastMinimum fails.</p>

### Advisory: Tips for streamlined test processes

-   There are a variety of color contrast tools that can perform the algorithms necessary to determine the contrast. See <http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html> for possible testing tools that use an appropriate algorithm.
-   While text contained in logos rendered as images is exempt from this requirement, the image must still provide alternative text (e.g., via an alt attribute).

#### WCAG 2.0 Techniques
-   The following sufficient techniques and/or common failures were considered when developing this test procedure for this baseline requirement:
    -   [G18: Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 exists between text (and images of text) and background behind the text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html)
    -   [G145: Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 exists between text (and images of text) and background behind the text](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G145.html) (when the text is at least 18 point if not bold and at least 14 point if bold).
