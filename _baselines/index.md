## Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Testing Baseline for Web Accessibility

This is the Section 508 [Information and Communication Technology](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#defICT) (ICT) Testing Baseline ***for Web***, version 3.1 (published April 1, 2024). This Baseline identifies the minimum requirements of any test process used to determine conformance of web content with the [Revised Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973](https://www.access-board.gov/ict), as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d).

[Previous versions of the Baseline for Web](https://github.com/atbcb/ICTTestingBaseline/releases) are available on the Github repository.

### ACOP Best Practice
The ICT Testing Baseline for Web is a Best Practice of the Federal CIO Council Accessibility Community of Practice (ACOP). Federal agencies are encouraged to utilize the Baseline for Web in their efforts to test web content for Section 508 conformance.

### How to contribute
You are welcome to create forks of the proposed Testing Baseline, propose improvements (via issues and pull requests), and submit test cases to help validate test processes and tools. The working group will post the ICT Testing Baseline for Web to [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/atbcb/ICTTestingBaseline).
