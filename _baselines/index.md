## Overview

The [Information and Communication Technology](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#defICT) (ICT) Testing Baselines establish the minimum requirements for evaluating the conformance of ICT with the [Revised Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973](https://www.access-board.gov/ict), as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d). These Baselines serve as a critical benchmark for evaluating the quality of test processes that support digital accessibility conformance across federal agencies.

What the ICT Testing Baseline Is:

* A collection of procedures that define the critical elements a conformance test process should evaluate.  
* A framework for evaluating Section 508 conformance test processes, providing a unified way to determine how they align with the applicable Baseline tests.
* An approach that helps agencies apply a consistent approach to accessibility testing.  
* Testing tool agnostic.

What the ICT Testing Baseline Is NOT:

* A step-by-step testing procedure or methodology.  
* A specific testing tool or software for Section 508 conformance testing.

## ICT Testing Baseline for Web Accessibility

The [ICT Testing Baseline for Web](web-baselines/introduction/), version 3.1 (published April 1, 2024), sets the standard for testing web content against Section 508 compliance requirements. This baseline is recognized as a Best Practice by the Federal CIO Councilâ€™s Accessibility Community of Practice (ACOP). Federal agencies are encouraged to adopt this baseline when evaluating web content for accessibility.

[Previous versions of the Baseline for Web](https://github.com/atbcb/ICTTestingBaseline/releases) are available on the Github repository.

## ICT Testing Baseline for Electronic Documents

The [ICT Testing Baseline for Electronic Documents](document-baselines/00introductionDocs/), Version 1.0 (published September 30, 2024), sets the standard for testing all types of electronic documents against Section 508 compliance requirements. Federal agencies are encouraged to adopt this baseline when evaluating non-web electronic documents for accessibility, ensuring coverage of both present and future formats.

## Future ICT Testing Baselines

In addition to web content and electronic documents, the ICT Testing Baseline Portfolio will expand to include future baselines for software, hardware, and other potential types of ICT. These upcoming baselines will harmonize accessibility testing processes in diverse ICT domains and ensure consistent conformance to Section 508 requirements across federal agencies.

This section will also provide announcements about the development and progress of these future baselines as they become available.

## WCAG 2.2

The [Section 508 requirements for electronic content](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#E205-content) reference the WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA Success Criteria. Although Section 508 does not mandate compliance with WCAG 2.2, the Baseline references the improved explanations and guidance from WCAG 2.2 documentation.

## How to Contribute

We invite you to contribute to the ongoing development of the ICT Testing Baselines. You can:

* Fork the repository and propose improvements via issues and pull requests.  
* Submit test cases to help validate test processes and tools.

The ICT Testing Baseline Working Group (ITBWG) maintains the ICT Testing Baseline for Web and for Documents on [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/atbcb/ICTTestingBaseline).
