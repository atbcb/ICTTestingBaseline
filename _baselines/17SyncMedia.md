### Test Method Rationale

Evaluation of captions and audio descriptions to assess its equivalence to synchronized media content generally involves a manual, cognitive comparison of the original content with its alternative(s). Media that are clearly labeled as a media alternative for text are tested to assess equivalence to the text and if not equivalent, the tests for captions and audio descriptions are to be performed.

### Limitations, Assumptions, or Exceptions

-   [Synchronized media](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-synchronized-media) is audio or video synchronized with another format for presenting information and/or with time-based interactive components, unless the media is a media alternative for text that is clearly labeled as such. Synchronized media includes, but is not limited to Web casts, press conferences, and online training presentations.
-   [Media alternative for text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-media-alternative-for-text) is media that presents no more information than is already presented in text (directly or via text alternatives). Note: A media alternative for text is provided for those who benefit from alternate representations of text. Media alternatives for text may be audio-only, video-only (including sign-language video), or audio-video.
-   [Captions](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-captions) are synchronized visual and/or text alternative for both speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the media content. Additional notes from definition:
    -   Note 1: Captions...convey not only the content of spoken dialogue, but also equivalents for non-dialogue audio information needed to understand the program content, including sound effects, music, laughter, speaker identification and location.
    -   Note 4: Captions should not obscure or obstruct relevant information in the video.
-   [Audio descriptions](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-audio-descriptions) are narration added to or combined with the soundtrack to describe important visual details that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack alone.
-   Captions and audio descriptions need to be available but do not need to be enabled by default.
-   Captions and audio descriptions can be provided in separate media files, i.e., audio described version and captioned version are different files.
-   Transcripts and non-synchronized alternatives alone will not meet this requirement.
-   Captions are not needed when the synchronized media is, itself, an alternate presentation of information that is also presented via text on the Web page.
-   Live captions Exception: Two-way multimedia calls between two or more individuals through web apps are not included in this test; it is only intended for broadcast of synchronized media.
-   From [Understanding SC 1.2.5](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/audio-description-prerecorded), if all of the information in the video track is already provided in the audio track, no audio description is necessary.
-   For this Section 508 baseline, synchronized media is tested for SC 1.2.5; (Level A) SC 1.2.3 is not tested. At the higher conformance level AA, SC 1.2.5 requires audio descriptions and is more strict than SC 1.2.3.

### Advisory: Tips for streamlined test processes

-   Testing synchronized media is different from testing Baseline [16. Audio-Only and Video-Only content](../16AudioVideo).
-   Synchronized media players may be software or HTML.
-   At Level AA, SC 1.2.5 applies to synchronized media. The related Level A requirement, SC 1.2.3, should be marked as ‘Not Applicable’ in the test report. It is permissible for test processes to add a test for SC 1.2.3 (evaluate a full text alternative for equivalence). Adding such a test would exceed baseline test requirements and would not affect Baseline 17’s outcome.
-   All synchronized multimedia should be tested. If the pre-recorded multimedia is labeled as an media alternative for text, confirm that it provides equivalent information as text. If it does not, then it is not a media alternative for text. Test the multimedia for captions and audio descriptions. It may make sense to perform Test 17.G before testing for captions and audio descriptions.
