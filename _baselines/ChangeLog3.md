| 5. Changing Content | Significant changes to this test to cover SC 4.1.2 more accurately. Name of test changed to 5. User Controls. |
| 6. Images | Limitations, Assumptions, Exceptions: removed "Equivalent descriptions for an image within page text could allow an image to be considered decorative. However, this does not necessitate removal of any accessible text attributes from the image." |
| 6. Images | Test Method Rationale: added "The image tests evaluate the images as they were coded to indicate whether they are meaningful or decorative, leaving that determination to the author of the content. However, there are certain scenarios as described in the tests where the author's determination would be incorrect." |
| 6.1, 6.2 | Test Procedures updated to defer to author to determine meaningful or decorative images, W3C Image Tutorials added under WCAG Techniques section |
| 7. Sensory Characteristics | Advisory: corrected first bullet to remove "must also provide textual cues" |
| 7.3 Audible Cues | New test added which maps to SC 1.1.1 |

| 10. Forms | Test Procedure for Form Changes removed. |

| 16.1 Audio Only | Instruction 2: replaced image of text with an image-only PDF as a more real-world example |

### Version 3.0.1, March 2021
All of the changes made in this version were made to the structure of the Baseline test pages to enable anchor references to a specific part of the tests.
  * Added IDs to Identify Content, Test Instructions, Test Results of all Tests
  * Improved consistency of outline numbers in the Tests
  * Added an Identify Content section to Baseline Test 17.5. No other content changes were made.

### Version 3.0, September 2020
Version 3.0 is a major change to the Section 508 ICT Testing Baseline and supporting content. This version contains significant changes to the ICT Testing Baseline to address the Section 508 Refresh and incorporation of the WCAG 2.0 Level A and Level AA Success Criteria. However, the document also includes a number of other changes to improve the organization and flow of the document, Baseline test logic, and readability of test steps. These changes include:
  * General alignment of Test Condition construction with the draft W3C Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Task Force Test Rules Format.
  * Removed references to Failure Conditions and reconstructed as "Checks" in test instructions, with positive pass/fail construction to eliminate double negatives.
  * The revised Baseline test instructions include conditions to "identify content" to test. If those conditions are not met, the test does not apply.
  * Addition of unique Baseline Test IDs for easier reference and traceability.
Finally, the test instructions have entirely removed any reference to any testing tools. The revised ICT Testing Baseline is a tool-agnostic set of test instructions that describe what to test and what conditions web content must meet to be considered conformant, without prescribing specific procedures or tools. Federal agencies and other organizations may define their own test procedures, using their preferred test tools while still maintaining alignment with the ICT Testing Baseline.
